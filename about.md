## About me

I am a recent graduate from Midland College and will be attending Western Governors University starting in June. At Midland College,
I studied Information Technology with an emphasis on Networking. Last Winter, I passed the CCNA Routing and Switching Exam,
along with the Comptia A+ exam. I should be taking the Network+ exam shortly.
